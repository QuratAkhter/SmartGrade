1,"Data science is a field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract insights and knowledge from data. It involves various steps like data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The insights gained are used to support decision-making in businesses and research."
2,Data science is about using tools like Excel and SQL to store and organize data. Itâ€™s mostly about databases and making tables that help keep records. I think itâ€™s important for organizing data in companies and hospitals.
3,"Data science is the process of analyzing large amounts of data to make predictions and informed decisions. It involves machine learning, data mining, and statistical modeling. Itâ€™s widely used in industries like healthcare, finance, and marketing to improve performance."
4,I think data science is related to computer science but mainly used in science labs to analyze experiments and test results. Scientists use it to see if their chemical reactions or biological experiments are successful.
5,"Data science involves machine learning and AI. Itâ€™s the same thing as artificial intelligence because both are used to automate tasks using data and code. For example, chatbots and robots use data science to function."
6,Data science is a career where people code a lot in Python or R to find hidden patterns in big data. They use libraries like pandas and scikit-learn to analyze datasets and make visualizations. It helps in improving decisions.
7,"In my opinion, data science is only about creating graphs and charts from Excel files. It helps to make reports and dashboards. Itâ€™s a part of business presentations that show monthly sales or performance results."
8,Data science helps companies to understand customer behavior by analyzing data collected from apps and websites. It uses algorithms to predict what customers will do next. This is very helpful in digital marketing and recommendation systems.
9,It is a branch of computer science that teaches us how to store and retrieve data using databases. Data science also teaches us how to write queries in SQL and structure the information in tables.
10,"Data science is an interdisciplinary field that extracts meaningful insights from data by using statistical analysis, machine learning models, and domain-specific techniques. It plays a vital role in solving real-world problems by enabling data-driven decision-making."
